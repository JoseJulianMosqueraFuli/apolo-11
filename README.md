This repository is part of the Python Bootcamp NASA challenge, known as Apollo 11. It implements a Simulation and Monitoring System designed to simulate a monitoring system for NASA's crucial Apollo 11 mission.

## Overview

The system performs the following tasks:

- Generates simulated device data logs for various NASA missions.
- Analyzes log data and computes statistics for mission-critical reporting.
- Manages data logs, storage, and archiving processes.
- Outputs a visual dashboard for tracking device status.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the main entrypoint script `main.py`. Ensure that you have installed all required dependencies within a virtual environment.
